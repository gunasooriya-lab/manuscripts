This repository contains the ase databases with VASP-optimized final structures of all electronic structure optimizations (unit_cell, pristine_surfaces, saa_surface, saa_bulk, daa_dimer, and daa_trimer).

A Jupyter notebook (accessing_data.ipynb) is included to show how to connect to the databases, visualize key-value pairs, and copy data from a database to Pandas. 

Software: VASP 5.4.1, functional: RPBE
