Authors: S.A. Keishana Navodye, G.T. Kasun Kalhara Gunasooriya

In VASP_structure_files directory, you could find the final structures (CONTCAR) of all electronic structure optimizations under four categories (unitcell, low_coverage,  high_anions_coverage and high_surface_O_coverage).

In each category, VASP_inputs directory consists of example INCAR and KPOINTS file used to run the electronic structure optimizations.

Software: VASP 5.4.1, functional: PBE

Source_data.xlsx file contains all the data which can be used to reproduce the figures in the main manuscript.
