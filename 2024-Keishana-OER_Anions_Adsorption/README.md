S.A. Keishana Navodye, G.T. Kasun Kalhara Gunasooriya

This repository contains the VASP-optimized final structures (CONTCAR) of all the electronic structure optimizations (unitcell, low_coverage,  high_anions_coverage, and high_surface_O_coverage).

In each folder, the VASP_inputs directory consists of sample INCAR and KPOINTS files used to run the electronic structure optimizations.

Software: VASP 5.4.1, functional: PBE

Source_data.xlsx file contains all the data which can be used to reproduce the figures in the main manuscript.
